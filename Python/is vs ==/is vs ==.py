A common pitfall is confusing the equality comparison operators is and ==.
a == b compares the value of a and b.
a is b will compare the identities of a and b.
To illustrate:
a = 'Python is fun!'
b = 'Python is fun!'
a == b # returns True
a is b # returns False
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = a # b references a
a == b # True
a is b # True
b = a[:] # b now references a copy of a
a == b # True
a is b # False [!!]
Basically, is can be thought of as shorthand for id(a) == id(b).
Beyond this, there are quirks of the run-time environment that further complicate things. Short strings and small
integers will return True when compared with is, due to the Python machine attempting to use less memory for
identical objects.
a = 'short'
b = 'short'
c = 5
d = 5
a is b # True
c is d # True
But longer strings and larger integers will be stored separately.
a = 'not so short'
b = 'not so short'
c = 1000
d = 1000
a is b # False
c is d # False
